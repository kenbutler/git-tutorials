                This section aims to provide a solid foundation for the basic commands required to use Git.
                To understand the applicability of the basic commands, this tutorial will follow a scenario.

            <h4>Types of Repository Storage</h4>
            <p class="common-text-justified">
                There are two ways a Git repository can be stored and managed:
                locally on a personal computer or remotely on a server. Storing remotely permits distributed teamwork.
                It is worth noting that a locally stored repository can be moved to a server if desired.

                While there are ways to go straight from file changes to committing without staging, it is best practice
                to stage files prior to committing them. It's also worth noting that files can be staged and unstaged,
                but once you commit, you cannot undo. (Well, technically you can, but it’s not as straight forward
                and is covered in more advanced topics.)

                themselves.

            <p class="common-text-justified">
                Git uses the term <em>fetch</em> to indicate it is grabbing updates from the server
                and storing them locally -- but is <u>NOT</u> integrating them into any of your local branches.
                <br><br>
                To fetch updates, select the <em>Fetch</em> button from the top-menu.
                You will likely only need to check the box <em>Fetch from all remotes</em>.
                (The other options are beyond the scope of this section).

                You will notice that we fetched another update from Chewbacca’s branch.
                He has not merged his latest change into the development branch,
                so we’ll assume he’s still in development for now.
                Let’s merge in the latest updates from the <span class="code">development</span> branch.

                    Select the commit that you want merge in.

                    To explain the options at the bottom:<br>
                    - <span style="color: yellow;"><b><em>Commit merge immediately (if no conflicts)</em></b></span> :
                    This will make a commitment saying you’ve merged in changes from another branch
                    immediately upon merging.
                    <br>
                    - <span style="color: yellow;"><b><em>Include messages from commits...</em></b></span> :
                    This is pretty self-explanatory
                    <br>
                    - <span style="color: yellow;"><b><em>Create a commit...</em></b></span> :
                    The tricky part here is <b><em>fast-forward</em></b>.
                    If a branch has been updated on the server but the local branch has not,
                    sometimes it is just like fast-forwarding the branch in time through the Git history.
                    In this case, we do not typically need a new commit, but the option is here if you do want it.
                    <br>
                    - <span style="color: yellow;"><b><em>Rebase instead of merge...</em></b></span> :
                    Rebasing is an advanced topic outside the scope of this section,
                    so don’t worry about it and simply leave it unchecked.

                While it is best practice to pull from the main <span class="code">development</span> branch,

                For example, maybe you and another programmer are working on a task in tandem.
                In this scenario, let’s pull in the extra work Chewbacca has done.
                <br><br>
                Select <em>Pull</em> from the top menu and specify Chewbacca’s development branch.

                git pull = git fetch + git merge
