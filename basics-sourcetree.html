                This section aims to provide a solid foundation for the basic commands required to use Git.
                To understand the applicability of the basic commands, this tutorial will follow a scenario.

            <h4>Types of Repository Storage</h4>
            <p class="common-text-justified">
                There are two ways a Git repository can be stored and managed:
                locally on a personal computer or remotely on a server. Storing remotely permits distributed teamwork.
                It is worth noting that a locally stored repository can be moved to a server if desired.

                While there are ways to go straight from file changes to committing without staging, it is best practice
                to stage files prior to committing them. It's also worth noting that files can be staged and unstaged,
                but once you commit, you cannot undo. (Well, technically you can, but it’s not as straight forward
                and is covered in more advanced topics.)

                If you return to the initial figure that SourceTree brings up,

                Please note that <em>these commits exist on the remote server only because I pushed them up there</em>.

                        This can be changed, but it’s usually not necessary.
                        You will see we have one branch called <em>master</em> and another called <em>origin/master</em>.
                        The one pre-pended with <em>origin/</em> is what the <em>server</em> sees,
