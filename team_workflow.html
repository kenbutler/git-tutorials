            <h3>Team Workflow</h3>
            <p class="common-text-justified">
                This section aims to provide a general idea of how Git can be useful to team-based software development.
                <br>
                Let's see how this works through a scenario!

                After testing his code, C3PO files a <b>pull request</b> to notify the <b>integration lead</b>.
            </p>
            <img src="img/team-workflow/pull-request.png" width="50%" alt="Pull request">
            <p class="common-text-justified" style="font-size:18px;">
                The purpose of a pull request is to help prevent buggy or undesirable code from being pushed into a
                working branch. It’s also just helpful to facilitate communication amongst a team to prevent bad updates
                from getting into the repository.

                It is <b>very important that the master branch always exists in a good, clean, valid state</b>.
                It assists in incremental delivery to customers, provides a solid baseline for any newcomers, and acts
                as a great reference for the entire repository.<br><br>

                Not all repositories use pull requests. Branches, such as the master branch,
                can be locked to prevent uncoordinated changes, but no branches are locked by default.
                Some repositories are configured without locks on any branches. In this case, it is highly recommended
                that the developer communicate with the team lead prior to bringing in any code from his development
                branch to the master or any other branch.<br><br>

                Regardless of how the communication occurs, the team lead will likely want to test the code out
                him/herself prior to bring it into the master branch.

            <p class="common-text-justified" style="font-size:18px;">
                It is good practice to create a branch off the HEAD of the mainline branch for integration testing.
                <br>
                (The HEAD of any branch is essentially the most-recent commit in the history of the
                branch. You may have heard of or seen references to a ’detached head’ state. Being in a
                ‘detached head’ state within Git simply means that you are NOT at the tip of your branch.)

                <b>
                    If testing fails or merging conflicts raise additional questions, the team lead may contact the
                    developer with questions. If this is the case, mainline will NOT be updated.

                As team lead, Obi-Wan may choose to alert (either manually or through automatic notifications) the rest
                of the team that updates from the mainline branch are ready to pull.
                <br><br>
                He does not need to alert them at all though -- as <b>regularly fetching and pulling updates from the
                remote repository is simply good practice when using Git</b> (and fundamental to efficient software
                development).

                Regardless of how they find out, developers will pull in updates from mainline into their own
                branches. Depending on the situation, this may create merge conflicts. We will cover the handling of merge
                conflicts in another lesson. For understanding the general workflow though, let’s assume the merging
                went smoothly. After pulling in updates from mainline, R2D2 can now see C3PO’s additions!
                He may be able to use C3PO’s code in his own work – thus <b>collaboration amongst the team is clean,
                simple, and organized.</b>
