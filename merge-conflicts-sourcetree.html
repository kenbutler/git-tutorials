            <h3>Merge Conflicts</h3>
            <h4>Command Line Interface</h4>
            <p class="common-text-justified">
                When using Git in a team, it's inevitable that a merge conflict will arise <em>eventually</em>.
                Merge conflicts occur when trying to pull in updates to your local branch
                <em>or</em> when merging in another branch.
                Git tries to automatically integrate differences between the branches,
                but sometimes it's not clear to Git <em>which</em> side is correct.
                Rather than making an assumption about what the <em>correct</em> change is,
                Git will throw a merge conflict.
                Some instances may result in multiple merge conflicts.
                It's up to the user to resolve these merge conflicts before moving on.
                <br><br>
                It's important to understand both how a merge conflict can arise and how to resolve one.
                This section presents a simple scenario of how a merge conflict may present itself.
                It also addresses strategies for merge conflict resolution.

                Let's first consider <em>how merge conflicts arise</em>.

                <br><br>
                He then divvies out some tasks to his other team members.

                Vader may or may not realize it,
                but it is likely that both tasks will require editing of the same file.

                If Obi-Wan and Chewbacca worked on uniquely different pieces of the code for the same file,
                then it is no problem.
                If they worked on the same pieces of code – or even intertwined pieces of code -
                then this will certainly result in a merge conflict.

                When commiting a merge (whether it was ever conflicted or not),
                Git automatically creates a merge briefing.
                You can edit this message if you'd like, though it's not common or necessary.
