            <h3>Merge Conflicts</h3>
            <h4>Command Line Interface</h4>
            <p class="common-text-justified">
                When using Git in a team, it's inevitable that a merge conflict will arise <em>eventually</em>.
                Merge conflicts occur when trying to pull in updates to your local branch
                <em>or</em> when merging in another branch.
                Git tries to automatically integrate differences between the branches,
                but sometimes it's not clear to Git <em>which</em> side is correct.
                Rather than making an assumption about what the <em>correct</em> change is,
                Git will throw a merge conflict.
                Some instances may result in multiple merge conflicts.
                It's up to the user to resolve these merge conflicts before moving on.
                <br><br>
                It's important to understand both how a merge conflict can arise and how to resolve one.
                This section presents a simple scenario of how a merge conflict may present itself.
                It also addresses strategies for merge conflict resolution.

                Let's first consider <em>how merge conflicts arise</em>.

                They typically occur when multiple developers touch the same file.

                <br><br>
                He then divvies out some tasks to his other team members.

                Vader may or may not realize it,
                but it is likely that both tasks will require editing of the same file.

                Unlike the previous scenario, merge conflicts are not always as easily foreseen.
                Often, developers simply pull in updates and may initially have no idea why they occurred!
                Given this, it's worth approaching <em>how to solve</em> merge conflicts in a way that a developer
                would normally experience them. So let's introduce a new scenario for this and begin fresh.
                <br><br>
                In a galaxy far, far away, another software team faces another merge conflict...

                Obi-Wan tries to pull in Chewbacca's branch, but runs into a merge conflict!
                The details show that the problem lies in the README file:

                    If you've encountered a merge conflict, you may want to first consult with peers before proceeding.
                    If they are not immediately available to you, you may want to <em>abort</em> the merge
                    and proceed with it later.
                    There are other reasons you may want to abort a merge as well.
                    Regardless, if you want to abort a merge, you can use this command from the command line:
                </p>
                <p class="code" style="color: blue;">
                    git merge --abort

                        We see that the file has additions, which include some weird things like angular brackets,

                Set up your Git config to open an external editor for merging.
                The initial set up of this can be slightly complicated, but overall it is worth it.

                Resolving conflicts is very context specific.
                In this particular scenario, we may want to keep both additions from users.
                Let's assume that, whichever path you've decided to go down, you've sorted out the conflict in the file.
                Git still needs to be told that all merge conflicts have been resolved.
                First, we must stage the resolved files using
                <span class="code" style="color: blue">git add</span>.
                You'll see that Git created a copy of the <em>original</em> file with the extension <b>.orig</b>
                in the process of throwing a merge conflict.

            <h4>How to Resolve Merge Conflicts</h4>
            <p class="common-text-justified">
                Now that you've staged the file, simply enter: &emsp;
                <span class="code" style="color: blue;">git commit</span>
                <br>
                but <em><b>without</b></em> the including a commit message.
                Git should open a page like the one below, containing details of the merge.
                You can edit this message if you'd like, though it's not common or necessary.
                You'll see this same briefing for an unconflicted merge as well.
